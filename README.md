# Real-time-SDR-for-mono-stereo-FM-and-RDS
The main objective of the project is to navigate a complex (industry-level) specification and understand
the challenges that must be addressed for a real-time implementation of a computing system that operates
in a form factor-constrained environment [1]. The project covers the application of communication
concepts in computer engineering design and the practical set up of a software-implemented radio
receiver, expected to run in real time.

# Here is a short demo!
